## Dev Environment Setup (macOS)

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK** (stable channel, 3.41+)
- **Xcode** with iOS Simulator installed
- **Android Studio** with Android SDK 36+
- **CocoaPods** (`brew install cocoapods`)
- **CMake** (`brew install cmake`) — required by `opencv_dart` / `dartcv4` to compile OpenCV from source during the native build
- **Mapbox account** with two tokens (see below)

> **CMake note:** `dartcv4` uses a Dart native-assets build hook that invokes CMake. Xcode's restricted build environment may not include `/opt/homebrew/bin` in its PATH. If the build fails with `Failed to find cmake version: latest`, symlink it:
>
> ```bash
> sudo ln -sf /opt/homebrew/bin/cmake /usr/local/bin/cmake
> ```
>
> The first build after adding `opencv_dart` compiles OpenCV from source and takes several minutes. Subsequent builds use the cached artifacts.

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone <repo-url> && cd atlix
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Mapbox token setup

You need **two** Mapbox tokens. Neither is stored in the repo.

#### Public token (used at runtime in the app)

Create a public token at [mapbox.com/account/access-tokens](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/) with default scopes:

- `styles:tiles`, `styles:read`, `fonts:read`, `datasets:read`

Then create a `.env` file in the project root (gitignored):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and paste your public token
```

```
MAPBOX_PUBLIC_TOKEN=pk.your_token_here
```

#### Secret token (used at build time to download the SDK)

Create a **secret** token with the `downloads:read` scope. This token is used by CocoaPods (iOS) and Gradle (Android) to authenticate when downloading the Mapbox SDK binary. It never ships in the app.

**iOS — `~/.netrc`**

Add to `~/.netrc` (create it if it doesn't exist):

```
machine api.mapbox.com
  login mapbox
  password sk.your_secret_token_here
```

Then restrict permissions:

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.netrc
```

> `~/.netrc` is a standard Unix credential file. Tools like `curl`, CocoaPods, and Gradle read it to authenticate HTTP requests. Mapbox's CocoaPods spec fetches the SDK from `api.mapbox.com` and uses `~/.netrc` for auth automatically.

**Android — `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`**

Add to `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` (create if needed):

```properties
SDK_REGISTRY_TOKEN=sk.your_secret_token_here
```

### 3. Verify setup

```bash
flutter doctor        # Should show no issues
```

## Build, Test & Run

All commands should be run from the project root.

### Analyze (lint)

```bash
flutter analyze
```

### Run tests

```bash
flutter test                                    # All tests
flutter test test/ballistics_test.dart          # Ballistics solver tests only
flutter test test/pattern_engine_test.dart      # Shotgun pattern engine tests only
```

### Boot a simulator

**iOS (recommended for dev):**

```bash
open -a Simulator                                           # Opens Simulator.app
xcrun simctl boot "iPhone 15 Pro"                           # Boot a specific device
```

**Android:**

```bash
flutter emulators --launch Nexus_6P_API_34                  # Or whichever AVD you have
```

Check available devices:

```bash
flutter devices
```

### Add test images to the simulator gallery

The iOS Simulator has no camera, so to test **Animal Track Identification** you need to pre-load a photo into the simulator's Photos library. Use `simctl addmedia`:

```bash
xcrun simctl addmedia booted ~/Downloads/deer.jpeg
```

`booted` targets whichever simulator is currently running. You can also use the device name:

```bash
xcrun simctl addmedia "iPhone 15 Pro" ~/Downloads/deer.jpeg
```

The image will appear in **Photos → Recents** inside the simulator. When testing track ID, choose **Photos** (gallery) instead of Camera to pick it.

### Set simulator GPS location

Simulators don't use your Mac's real GPS — they default to San Francisco. Override it:

**iOS Simulator:**

```bash
xcrun simctl location <device-id> set <lat>,<lon>
# Example: Nova Scotia
xcrun simctl location 4873414E-D97C-441E-AB4E-7A842CDCE72E set 45.0618,-63.4050
```

Or via the Simulator app menu: **Features → Location → Custom Location**.

**Android Emulator:**

```bash
adb emu geo fix <lon> <lat>
# Example: Nova Scotia (note: longitude comes first)
adb emu geo fix -63.4050 45.0618
```

Or via Android Studio: **Extended Controls (⋯) → Location** → enter coordinates → **Set Location**.

### Run the app

The Mapbox public token is passed at compile time from `.env` — never hardcoded:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env                    # Picks first available device
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=.env -d <device-id>     # Target a specific device
```

### Build (release)

```bash
flutter build ios --dart-define-from-file=.env              # iOS archive
flutter build apk --dart-define-from-file=.env              # Android APK
```

### Android SDK note

Flutter 3.41+ requires Android SDK 36. If `flutter doctor` complains:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager "platforms;android-36" "build-tools;36.0.0"
```

## What the POC deliberately skips

- No backend / no auth / no sync
- No MIL output (inches + MOA + clicks only)
- No shot history
- Imperial units only
